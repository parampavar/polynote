### Why Polynote?

See the [Why?](https://github.com/polynote/polynote#why) section of our README for more information.

### Where can I find example notebooks? 

We've created several example notebooks to showcase common use cases for Polynote - to see them, either 
navigate to `./docs-site/docs/docs/examples` in your local directory or view them on GitHub [here](https://github.com/polynote/polynote/tree/master/docs-site/docs/docs/examples). 

These examples are pre-populated into the Docker distribution of Polynote. 

### Does Polynote have support for headless mode/programmatic execution of notebooks? 

Polynote has a very rudimentary notebook runner that can be accessed via the command line today, however there is not currently full support for the programmatic execution of notebooks. You can track this issue [here](https://github.com/polynote/polynote/issues/1052).
